DEReK
=====

Welcome to the Durham Electronic RElaxation (K)Code, DEReK for short! A planewave Ab Initio DFT code.
This is a simple all electron, plane-wave Density Functional Theory code for calculating electronic structures. This a toy project started during my PhD at Durham University and as such there are no guarantees that this produces accurate results. In addition, it is likel not very useful to many as it does not contain any crystal information, there are no atoms as such, although they could be included through a user provided external potential.

I must also appologise for the tortured acronym. This is named for my grandfather (Derek for those of you not paying attention...) so some linguistic acrobatics had to be performed.
